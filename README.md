### version 1.0.1
HusHousing is a simple celo-inspired dapp that allows users view and buy houses using the celo stable token;cUsd.
Users can safely buy and sell houses free from the influence of middle-men financial institutions.
The Overall Idea of HusHousing is being able to buy not just already made houses but also lands, estates, partake in Estate developments 
as well as partaking in Estate Share Holding.
All these features will be reflected inn subsquent versions of the Dapp.
